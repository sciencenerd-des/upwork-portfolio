## What It Solves

Organizations generate massive amounts of data but struggle to turn it into actionable reports. Manual report creation is:

1. Accepts CSV/Excel uploads via drag-and-drop
2. Intelligently maps columns to report templates
3. Generates professional charts and visualizations
4. Produces PDF and Word documents instantly
5. Optionally adds AI-powered insights

| Report generation time | 4 hours | 30 seconds |
